    scripts.
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Events can now be pushed to Eventive from their respective site, provided
      the database analyzer finds no 'errors' (messages in red). Please note
      that this could not be thoroughly tested because of incomplete databases
      etc, so always check whether everything worked as intended by reviewing
      the event on Eventive after it has been created.
    </li>
    <li>
      Similarly, a button will show up to let you create a virtual event for
      live-streamed events. Again, this is intended as a point of departure and
      should be checked for correctness.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added a 'stats' script, which writes relevant statistics about various
      metrics to Notion and lets you track those over time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added an 'experimental' section for untested scripts. First off is a
      script that (hopefully..) will help you create virtual screenings.

    </li>
    <li>
      Events can now be pushed to WordPress Note that this is limited to name,
      text and image due to API restraints, so some manual work will still have
      to be done after having pushed an event.
    </li>
    <li>
      Films that have 'digital approval' property checked will have this
      reflected on their catalogue page.

    <li>'School' property will now appear on exported catalogue pages.</li>
    <li>

      assigned.

      on this in person.
    </li>
