Welcome! This site gives you access to various
<a href="{{ url_for('scripts.scripts_overview') }}">scripts</a> 
that let you perform common festival-related tasks in an efficient,
consistent and time-saving manner. It also acts as an alternative way of 
exploring and quality-checking the contents of the database.

<div class="content-section">

<p>
Please note that, in spite of my best efforts to make this site and
the scripts it lets you perform as robust and user-friendly as possible, this is
my first attempt at a project of this scale and complexity. Bugs can and will occur, 
the visual presentation is rather basic, and I rely
on your input to keep improving the user experience. Don't hesitate to let me 
know about any errors you might encounter, functions and improvements you would 
like to see 
or any other feedback you might have! 
</p>

<p>
With that being said, the 
<a href="{{ url_for('scripts.db_analyzer') }}">Database Analyzer script</a>
is not only intended to spot common mistakes in formatting and such, but will
also help avoid database errors that can prevent the scripts from performing 
as expected. If you can think of a check that should be integrated, please 
let me know.
</p>

<p>
The <em>database explorer</em> pulls the most important information about 
<a href="{{ url_for('dbviews.films_overview') }}">films</a>,
<a href="{{ url_for('dbviews.guests_overview') }}">guests</a> and
<a href="{{ url_for('dbviews.events_overview') }}">events</a> 
from Notion and lets you view the database entries without any disctracting clutter.
You will also find related links, scripts and other helpful information on the detail pages.
</p>

<p>
The 
<a href="{{ url_for('main.log') }}">log</a> 
provides some feedback as scripts are executed, and is a good first place to 
check if something did not go as planned. Additionally, you will find some
tips and best practices in the sidebar.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, I intend to update this site with fixes, improvements and new features
regularly. You can check the
<a href="{{ url_for('main.changelog') }}">What's new?</a> section to keep up with
the latest developments, and get a sneak peek of what's to come in the sidebar.
</p>

<p>
I hope you find value in this newest addition to the FAF toolbox
and enjoy exploring its features! :>
